- RPO 1v1
    -- Fix targeting functionality
    -- Make scenario customizable
        --- Sun vector works
        --- Positions work
        --- range and cats req do not function
        --- Changes in scenario length, number of burns
    -- Iterate on user interface
    -- Finite burn functionality

- Mission Planner
    -- Add targeting
    -- Iterate on user interface
    -- Add gray satellites
    -- Pre-built scenarios

- Classical Orbital Element Vis
    -- Add more visualizations and quick scenarios
        --- GPS constellation?
        --- Molniya Constellation?
        --- Iridium Constellation?
            ---- Yikes
        --- Starlink
            ---- Double Yikes
        --- Different satcom constellations
    -- Fix axis representations
    -- Ability to turn off stars
    -- Add delete functionality (necessary to switch between scenarios)
    -- Merge with RMOE Vis?

- RMOE Vis
    -- Add delete functionality (necessary to switch between scenarios)
    -- Add ellipse visual to in-plane

- Waypoint Planner
    -- Add satellite point to play function
    -- More precise physics?
        --- Maybe just update to more precise physics once user stops changing burn
    -- Continue to optimize
